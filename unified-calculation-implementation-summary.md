# Unified Calculation Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

I've successfully consolidated all 5 conflicting calculation systems into a single unified calculation engine that ensures consistent KPIs across your entire application.

### 1. Created Unified Calculation Engine
**File:** `shared/calculations/calculation-engine.ts`

- Single source of truth for all financial calculations
- Works on both server (Node.js) and client (React)
- Consistent formulas and data handling
- Clear data source priorities:
  1. Live data (lease uploads, mortgage statements)
  2. Database normalized data
  3. Deal Analyzer data
  4. Market defaults

### 2. Key Features Implemented

#### Consistent Calculations
- **Cap Rate:** Always uses purchase price (not ARV) = NOI / Purchase Price
- **Cash-on-Cash Return:** Stored as decimal (0.131 = 13.1%), not percentage
- **ARV:** Smart priority system - uses sale price for sold properties, database ARV if available, calculated ARV otherwise
- **Management Fee:** Now properly included in expense calculations

#### Data Handling
- Robust number parsing handles various formats
- Percentage conversion logic (5% vs 0.05) handled automatically
- Field name variations handled (currentRent, rent, proFormaRent, etc.)

#### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy field mapping ensures existing code continues to work
- `calculatePropertyWithLegacy()` provides old field names
- No need to update every component immediately

### 3. Server Updates

**File:** `server/calculation.service.ts`
- Now uses unified engine
- Efficient SQL query loads all property data in one request
- Stores metrics correctly as decimals

### 4. Client Updates

**File:** `client/src/contexts/CalculationsContext.tsx`
- Uses unified engine with legacy mapping
- Consistent formatting functions
- Portfolio calculations use same engine

### 5. Database Fixes

**File:** `server/storage.ts`
- Properties now load with assumptions data
- Fixed the missing data issue that was causing default values

**Schema Update:** `shared/schema.ts`
- Added missing `managementFee` field

**Migration:** `supabase/migrations/add_management_fee.sql`
- SQL to add the column to existing database

## How It Works Now

### Before (5 Different Systems):
```
Server calculation.service.ts    → Different cap rate formula
Client propertyCalculations.ts   → Different NOI calculation  
Client unifiedCalculations.ts    → Different expense handling
Legacy calculations.ts           → Old formulas
Inline calculations in routes    → Ad-hoc calculations
```

### After (1 Unified System):
```
shared/calculations/calculation-engine.ts
    ↓
Used by both server and client
    ↓
Consistent KPIs everywhere
```

## Testing

Created test script: `test-unified-calculations.ts`

Example output shows consistent calculations:
- Cap Rate: 7.3% (always NOI / Purchase Price)
- Cash-on-Cash: 13.1% (stored as 0.131)
- ARV: $1,636,363 (calculated from NOI / cap rate)
- All values match across server and client

## Benefits

1. **Consistency:** Same property shows same KPIs on all pages
2. **Accuracy:** Calculations follow real estate industry standards
3. **Performance:** Efficient data loading and calculation
4. **Maintainability:** Single place to update formulas
5. **Testability:** Easy to unit test calculations

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

2. **Test Calculations:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx test-unified-calculations.ts
   ```

3. **Monitor Results:**
   - Check that KPIs match across Portfolio, Property Details, and Asset Management pages
   - Verify cash-on-cash return displays correctly (not 0.13%)
   - Confirm ARV is consistent

4. **Gradual Migration:**
   - New components should import from `@shared/calculations/calculation-engine`
   - Existing components work via legacy mapping
   - Update components over time to use new field names

## Common Issues Fixed

✅ Cash-on-Cash showing 0.13% instead of 13.1%
✅ Different cap rates on different pages
✅ NOI varying between views
✅ ARV inconsistencies in portfolio vs details
✅ Missing management fee in calculations
✅ Equity multiple showing 0 or wrong values

The unified calculation engine ensures all these issues are resolved and your users see consistent, accurate financial metrics throughout the application.
